spocc 0.1.2
===============

NEW FEATURES

* There were quite a few changes in one of the key packages that `spocc` depends on: `rgbif`. A number of input and output parameter names changed. A new version of `rgbif` was pushed to CRAN. (#56)
* New function `clean_spocc()` started (not finished yet) to attempt to clean data. For example, one use case is removing impossible lat/long values (i.e., longitue values greater than absolute 180)
* New function `fixnames  ()` to trim species names with optional input parameters to make data easier to use for mapping.
* New function `wkt_vis()` to visualize a WKT (well-known text) area on a map. Uses ggmap to pull down a Google map so that the visualization has some geographic context and natural earth context. We'll soon introduce an interactive version of this function that will bring up a small Shiny app to draw a WKT area, then return that to your R session. (#34)

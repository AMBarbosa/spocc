R CMD CHECK passed on my local OS X install on R 3.2.3 and R development 
version, Ubuntu running on Travis-CI, and Win-Builder.

I apologize for submitting another version of this package so soon, but 
I found a bug that needed to be fixed quickly. I've fixed that bug and added 
many more unit tests.

Thanks! Scott Chamberlain
